description: '<p>The city-picker,A simple jQuery plugin for picking provinces, cities, districts and towns of China.(中国 / 省市区县 / 四级联动 / 地址选择器)</p>
<p>The old project only provides Three linkage but I need Four linkage,so I git clone the project and add Four linkage to it; It can be used as a full address picker and
    also can be used as a partial picker such as province picker. It is designed for computer browsers, but also available for browsers in other devices.</p>
